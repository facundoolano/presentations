* What is riak_core?

- Toolkit for building distributed, scalable,
  fault-tolerant applications.

- Erlang/OTP application developed by Basho.

- Used by the Riak database to distribute data and scale.

- Exposes Amazon's Dyamo architecture as a reusable library.

* What's riak_core good for?

- Distributed data stores.

- Routing of operations ensuring data locality.

- Any application that can benefit from decentralized
  distribution of work.

* Basho is dead, long live riak_core!

- Basho was put into receivership in 2017.

- Community took over maintenance and development of the projects.
  - Join the post-riak slack.

- Documentation was disperse and outdated.
  - We wrote riak_core_tutorial to consolidate the information and
    help run riak_core in a modern Erlang setup.

* Amazon Dynamo

[[https://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf]["Dynamo: Amazonâ€™s Highly Available Key-value Store" (2007)]]

- Availability > Consistency
  - No updates are rejected due to failures.

- Simple key/value Interfaces
  - No need for relational queries.

- Latency sensitive applications
  - < 300ms for 99.9% of the requests.

* Consistent hashing

- Each data item is assigned to a node by hashing its key.

- The output range of the hash is treated as a "ring".

- The ring is partitioned and distributed among nodes.

* Consistent hashing (cont.)

*Advantages*:
- Operations can be executed without node coordination.

- Adding or removing nodes only affect neighbors in the ring.

*Disadvantages*:
- Non-uniform data and load distribution.

* Nodes and Virtual Nodes

Each node is responsible for more than one virtual node,
i.e. more than one segment of the ring.

* Nodes and Virtual Nodes (cont.)
#+ATTR_ORG: :width 400
    [[./ring.png]]

*Advantages*:
- When a node becomes unavailable, the load is dispersed evenly
 to the rest.

- When a node comes back online, it takes load evenly from the
  rest.

- Nodes can be assigned vnodes according to its capacity.

* Questions?

  Before we move on.

* Interlude: Erlang/OTP behaviors

- Implement the generic parts of common patterns and defer the
  specific parts to a callback module.

- Similar to abstract classes with template methods in OOP land.

- Examples:

  - gen_server implements the server in a client/server relation

  - gen_fsm implements a finite-state machine process

* riak_core_vnode behavior

- Erlang behavior where you fill your application-specific logic.

- Worker process that receives commands.

- Implement PUT and GET commands for a Key/Value store:
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  -behaviour(riak_core_vnode).

  init([_Partition]) ->
    State = #{},
    {ok, State}.

  handle_command({put, Key, Value}, _Sender, State) ->
    NewState = State#{Key => Value},
    {reply, ok, NewState};

  handle_command({get, Key}, _Sender, State) ->
    Result = maps:get(Key, State, not_found),
    {reply, Result, State}.
#+END_SRC

- Call the PUT command with a Key/Value pair:
#+BEGIN_SRC erlang
  put(Key, Value) ->
    %% apply hash function to the key
    DocIdx = riak_core_util:chash_key({<<"rc_example">>, term_to_binary(Key)}),
    %% obtain preferred vnode to handle that key
    %% apl = active preference list
    PrefList = riak_core_apl:get_apl(DocIdx, 1, rc_example),
    [IndexNode] = PrefList,
    %% send command to the preferred vnode
    riak_core_vnode_master:sync_spawn_command(IndexNode, Command, rc_example_vnode_master).
#+END_SRC

* Demo!

- Start three Erlang nodes.

- Join the nodes into a riak_core cluster.

- Try the GET/PUT commands of the example Key/Value store.

* Advanced Topics

- Coverage commands
  - Commands that require querying all nodes and joining the results.
  - Example: list all keys in the Key/Value store.

- Redundancy and fault-tolerance
  - Send commands to N nodes.
  - Wait for R nodes to consider a read successful.
  - Wait for W nodes to consider a write successful.

- Handoff
  - *Ownership*: Redistribute partitions when a physical node is added
    or removed.
  - *Hinted*: Send back data that was temporarily stored in a secondary
    vnode.
